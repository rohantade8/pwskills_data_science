        "**How does it work?**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Identify Principal Components:** PCA calculates the **principal components**, which are new, uncorrelated features (axes) that capture the maximum variance in the data. These components are derived from the eigenvectors of the data's covariance matrix.\n",

        "\n",
        "* **Reduced complexity:** Analyzing and visualizing data becomes easier in fewer dimensions.\n",

        "- **PCA:** You can apply PCA to reduce the dimensionality to 2D by finding the principal components that capture the most variance in the spending patterns.\n",
        "- **Visualization:** Now, you can easily plot customers on a 2D map based on their spending habits, revealing clusters or trends that might be hidden in the original 3D space.\n",

        "While I can explain the steps of applying PCA for feature extraction in your dataset, the optimal number of principal components (PCs) to retain depends on several factors and requires further analysis. Here's an overview of the process and considerations:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Preprocessing:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Before applying PCA, ensure your data is clean and prepared:\n",
        "    - Handle missing values (e.g., imputation).\n",
        "    - Encode categorical features (e.g., one-hot encode \"gender\").\n",
        "    - Standardize numerical features (e.g., z-score normalization).\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Applying PCA:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Use a PCA algorithm to decompose the data's covariance matrix into eigenvectors and eigenvalues.\n",
        "- The eigenvectors (PCs) represent new, uncorrelated directions of maximum variance in the data.\n",
        "- The eigenvalues indicate the amount of variance explained by each PC.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Selecting PCs:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Scree plot:** This plot visualizes the eigenvalues in decreasing order. The \"elbow\" in the plot often suggests a good cut-off point for retaining PCs.\n",
        "- **Cumulative variance explained:** Calculate the percentage of variance explained by each PC cumulatively. Choose PCs that explain a high enough percentage of variance (e.g., 80-90%).\n",
        "- **Domain knowledge:** Consider the context of your problem and what information you want to retain.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Caveats and Considerations:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- PCA assumes linear relationships between features. If non-linear relationships exist, consider alternative techniques like t-SNE or UMAP.\n",
        "- Losing too much information by choosing too few PCs can hurt performance.\n",
        "- Evaluate the impact of different choices on your model's performance through experiments.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Specific to your dataset:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Analyzing height, weight, and age might reveal a dominant PC capturing \"body size.\"\n",
        "- Gender information might not hold much variance after encoding, but blood pressure could contribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Without access to your specific data and problem details, I cannot definitively recommend a number of PCs.** However, I hope this explanation gives you a framework for applying PCA and selecting appropriate components for your feature extraction task."

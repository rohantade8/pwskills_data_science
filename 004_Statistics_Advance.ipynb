However, they are used in different contexts depending on whether the random variable is discrete or continuous.\n",

        "Probability Mass Function (PMF):\n",
        "The PMF is used for describing discrete random variables. It gives the probability that a discrete random variable takes on a specific value. Mathematically, for a discrete random variable X, the PMF is denoted as P(X = x), where 'x' is a specific value that X can take.\n",

        "Consider the height of individuals in a population. Height is a continuous random variable because it can take any value within a certain range. The PDF would provide the probability density for different ranges of heights. However, since the probability of an exact value is infinitesimally small (due to the infinite number of possible values), we only talk about probabilities in terms of ranges. The total area under the PDF curve over a given range represents the probability of the random variable falling within that range.\n",

        "Definition: Covariance measures the direction and strength of the linear relationship between two variables, while correlation measures the direction and strength of the linear relationship between two variables, and also scales the relationship by the standard deviations of each variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Range: Covariance can take any value, including negative values, depending on the scale of the data, while correlation ranges from -1 to 1, with 0 indicating no linear relationship, -1 indicating a perfect negative linear relationship, and 1 indicating a perfect positive linear relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "Units of measure: Covariance is in units that are the product of the units of the two variables being measured, while correlation is a unitless measure that is normalized to fall between -1 and 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interpretation: Covariance can be difficult to interpret because it is dependent on the units of measurement of the variables, while correlation is a standardized measure that allows for easier interpretation of the strength and direction of the relationship between the two variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, while covariance and correlation both measure the relationship between two variables, correlation provides a more standardized and interpretable measure of the strength and direction of the linear relationship.\n",

        "Outliers are data points that lie far outside the range of the majority of the data points in a distribution. These data points can have a significant impact on measures of central tendency and dispersion.\n",
        "\n",
        "Measures of central tendency such as the mean, median, and mode are affected by outliers. The mean is particularly sensitive to outliers, as it is calculated by adding up all of the data points and dividing by the total number of data points. Outliers can greatly influence the value of the mean, pulling it towards their extreme value. The median is less sensitive to outliers, as it is calculated by finding the middle value of a sorted list of data points. However, if the outlier is extreme enough, it can still affect the median. The mode is generally not affected by outliers, as it represents the most frequently occurring value in a distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Measures of dispersion such as the range, interquartile range, variance, and standard deviation are also affected by outliers. The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a distribution and is heavily influenced by outliers. The interquartile range, which is the difference between the third quartile and the first quartile, is less sensitive to outliers as it only considers the middle 50% of the data. The variance and standard deviation, which measure the spread of the data around the mean, are also affected by outliers. Outliers can increase the variance and standard deviation, making the data appear more spread out than it actually is.\n",

        "For example, let's say we have a data set of the salaries of employees in a company, and the majority of the salaries are between $40,000 and $60,000. However, there is one employee who makes $1,000,000 a year. This outlier greatly affects the mean salary of the company, pulling it up towards the extreme value of $1,000,000. The median salary is less affected, as it is not influenced by extreme values, and would likely still be between $40,000 and $60,000. The range of the data set would also be greatly affected, as it would increase from $20,000 to $960,000. The standard deviation would also be affected, increasing and making the data appear more spread out than it actually is.\n",

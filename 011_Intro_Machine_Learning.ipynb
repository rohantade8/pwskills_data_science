        "Overfitting is when a model learns the training data too well and fails to generalize to new data. This means that the model performs well on the training data, but poorly on the test data. Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex or has too many free parameters.\n",
        "Underfitting is when a model does not learn the training data well enough. This means that the model performs poorly on both the training data and the test data. Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple or does not have enough free parameters.\n",
        "The consequences of overfitting and underfitting are as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "Overfitting: Overfitting leads to a model that is not generalizable. This means that the model will not be able to make accurate predictions on new data that it has not seen before.\n",

        "Regularization: Regularization is a technique that penalizes complex models. This helps to prevent overfitting by encouraging the model to learn simpler patterns. Common regularization techniques include L1 regularization, L2 regularization, and dropout.\n",
        "Early stopping: Early stopping is a technique that involves stopping the training process before the model has a chance to overfit the training data. This is done by monitoring the model's performance on a validation set. When the model's performance on the validation set starts to degrade, training is stopped.\n",
        "Data augmentation: Data augmentation is a technique that involves artificially increasing the size of the training dataset by creating new training examples from existing ones. This can help to prevent overfitting by providing the model with more data to learn from.\n",

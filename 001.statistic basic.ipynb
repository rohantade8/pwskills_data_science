Descriptive statistics can be used to provide information about the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of a distribution. Examples of descriptive statistics include mean, median, mode, range, standard deviation, and variance. For example, a researcher might use descriptive statistics to summarize the scores of students on a test, by calculating the mean and standard deviation of the scores.\n",

Examples of inferential statistics include hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis.

We can also use inferential statistics such as correlation, regression, and ANOVA to analyze the relationship between income and other variables.\n",

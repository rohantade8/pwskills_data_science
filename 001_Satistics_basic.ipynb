Descriptive statistics can be used to provide information about the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of a distribution. Examples of descriptive statistics include mean, median, mode, range, standard deviation, and variance. For example, a researcher might use descriptive statistics to summarize the scores of students on a test, by calculating the mean and standard deviation of the scores.\n",

Inferential statistics can be used to test hypotheses, estimate parameters, and make predictions about future events. Examples of inferential statistics include hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis. For example, a researcher might use inferential statistics to test whether there is a significant difference in the mean scores of two groups of students, such as a treatment group and a control group, on a test.\n",

If we were to use a mean to summarize the income data, it would be a valid measure of central tendency since the data is continuous and has a true zero point. We can also use inferential statistics such as correlation, regression, and ANOVA to analyze the relationship between income and other variables.\n",
